## DFS and BFS
- [261. Graph Valid Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/) \
If a graph is fully connected and contains exactly n - 1 edges, it can't possibly contain a cycle, and therefore must be a tree!


## Union Find
- [547. Number of Provinces](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/) \
Can also use DFS/BFS
